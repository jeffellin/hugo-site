I can never remember how to use CURL. Whenever I want to send some data I end up having to use google or try and dig through the terrible man pages. [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fsubfuzion%2F08c5d85437d5d4f00e58)

Today I leanred about a new tool called [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie). HTTPie is a command line tool that is way easier to use and understand than CURL.

Install it on the Mac

    brew install httpie

Post some data with CURL.

    curl -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" -X POST http://localhost:3000/data

The equivalent using HTTP Pie. The `==` operator is used to indicate a query string parameter.

    http POST http://localhost:3000/data param1==value param2==value2

Often as developers, we are testing code against `localhost`. Fortunately, there is a shorthand syntax for this common occurrence.

    http POST :3000/data param1==value param2==value2

Want to post a file? Use standard Unix pipes

    http POST :3000/data < file.json

Since JSON is commonly used during REST operations HTTP Pie helps us with that as well.

Suppose we want to send a document as shown below.

    {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
    }

by using the `=` sign we can tell HTTP Pie to construct the document.

    $ http PUT :3000 param1=value1 param2=value2

HTTP Pie will add the default encoding for JSON

    PUT / HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Content-Type: application/json
    { “param1”: “value1”, “param2”: “value2” }

Its even possible to create nested JSON structures such as

    {
        "age": 29,
        "hobbies": [
            "http",
            "pies"
        ],
        "description": "John is a nice guy who likes pies.",
        "married": false,
        "name": "John",
        "bookmarks": {
            "HTTPie": "http://httpie.org",
        }
    }
    

The above example from the HTTP Pie documentation is constructed using

    http PUT api.example.com/person/1 \
        name=John \
        age:=29 married:=false hobbies:='["http", "pies"]' \  # Raw JSON
        description=@about-john.txt \   # Embed text file
        bookmarks:=@bookmarks.json      # Embed JSON file
    

The `:=` operator is used for nonstring values and when you would like to embed a JSON file into the request.

Ever want to post a form with CURL? [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=post+form+using+curl)

    curl -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST http://localhost:3000/data
    

The below is the equivalent with HTTP Pie

    http --form POST :3000/data param1=value1 param2=value2
    

I never knew about this tool before today. In the past, I would resort to browser plugins like PostMan in order to make testing my services easier. Now that I know about HTTP Pie, I think I will try and make use of it more often.
